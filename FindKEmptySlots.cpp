 There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days. In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.
 
 Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.
 
 For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.
 
 Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.
 
 If there isn't such day, output -1.
 
 Example -
 Input:
 flowers: [1,3,2]
 k: 1
 Output: 2
 Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.
 
 
 Input:
 flowers: [1,2,3]
 k: 1
 Output: -1
