Optmizing your travel iterinary

Suppose you’re going to London for a nice vacation. 
You have two days there and a lot of things you want to do. 
You can’t do everything, so you make a list.


Attaction                Time          Rating
Westminster Abbey        0.5 day       7
Globe Theater			 0.5 dat       6
National Gallery         1 day         9
British Museum           2 days        9
St. Paul Cathedral       1/2 day       8


For each thing you want to see, you write down how long it 
will take and rate how much you want to see it. Can you 
figure out what you should see, based on this list?
