/*
 Given an array of positive integers, divide the array into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of the subsets is as small as possible.

 For example, given [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], return the sets {10, 25} and {5, 15, 20}, which has a difference of 5, which is the smallest possible difference.
