/*
 Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest path in the tree.

 For example, given the following tree:

    a
   /|\
  b c d
     / \
    e   f
   / \
  g   h
 and the weights: a-b: 3, a-c: 5, a-d: 8, d-e: 2, d-f: 4, e-g: 1, e-h: 1, the longest path would be c -> a -> d -> f, with a length of 17.

 The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any amount of children.
