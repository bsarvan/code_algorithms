 There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

 Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

 Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 
 Example 1 -
 Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 Output: true
 Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 
 
 Example 2 -
 Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 Output: false
 Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
